FeedFilter

Rudimentary RSS 2.0 feed filter implementation.

FeedFilter acts like a caching proxy between your RSS client and a
remote RSS feed of your choice.

The configurable filter is a list of regular expressions. Each regular
expression is applied on title and description of each RSS entry. If
none of the regular expressions matches, the respective entry is
discarded.

FeedFilter supports the HTTP Etag header for conditional requests.
RSS feeds will be cached in /tmp/feedfilter_*.

Requirements:

 * Webserver with PHP (tested with PHP 5.3)
 * PHP PECL HTTP Extension (pecl install pecl_http)

Installation:

 * Copy this directory to a htdocs-subdirectory of your webserver.
 * Edit index.php. Change the $url variable to the URL of the RSS
   feed you want to use. Edit the regular expressions.
